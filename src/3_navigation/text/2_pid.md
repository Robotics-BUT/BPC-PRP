# PID

This tutorial introduces the concept of PID control and demonstrates how to implement it in a step-by-step manner, suitable for university-level students.

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is one of the most widely used control algorithms in engineering and robotics. It is a feedback control mechanism used to maintain a desired setpoint by minimizing error in dynamic systems. PID controllers are found in applications ranging from industrial machinery to autonomous robots.


## PID Basics

A PID controller continuously calculates an error value `e(t)`, which is the difference between a desired setpoint `r(t)` and a measured process variable `y(t)`:

The controller output `u(t)` is computed as:

where:
 - `Kp` is Proportional gain.
 - `Ki` is Integral gain.
 - `Kd` is Derivative gain.

### Proportional Control `Kp`:

Responds to the current error.
Larger `Kp` leads to a faster response but may overshoot.

### Integral Control `Ki`

Responds to the accumulation of past errors.
Helps eliminate steady-state error.

### Derivative Control `Kd`

Responds to the rate of change of the error.
Predicts future behavior and reduces overshoot.

## PID Implementation

In digital systems, the continuous equation is approximated using discrete time intervals (dt):

### Algorithm

 - Measure the current system output `y[k]`.
 - Calculate the error: `e[k] = r[k] − y[k]`.
 - Compute the proportional, integral, and derivative terms.
 - Combine the terms to compute `u[k]`.
 - Apply `u[k]` to the system.
 - Repeat.

## Example Code

```python
class PIDController:

    def __init__(self, kp, ki, kd, setpoint=0.0, output_limits=(None, None), integral_limits=(None, None)):
        self.kp = kp
        self.ki = ki
        self.kd = kd
        self.setpoint = setpoint

        self.previous_error = 0
        self.integral = 0

    def update(self, measured_value, dt):
        error = self.setpoint - measured_value
        
        # P
        proportional = self.kp * error
        
        # I
        self.integral += error * dt
        integral = self.ki * self.integral
        
        # D
        derivative = self.kd * (error - self.previous_error) / dt
        
        self.previous_error = error
        output = proportional + integral + derivative
        return output
```

### Practical Tips
- Keep units consistent and sample time Δt stable; prefer a monotonic time base.
- Start with small gains to avoid saturation; increase gradually.
- Set `output_limits` to your actuator range (e.g., PWM 0–255) and use `integral_limits` to prevent windup.
- Consider computing the derivative on the measurement or apply a small low-pass filter to the D term if the signal is noisy.
- If the process variable is bounded (e.g., angle), consider wrapping errors appropriately.

## PID Tuning

### Manual Tuning

Start with `Ki = 0` and `Kd = 0`.
Increase `Kp` until the system oscillates.
Increase `Kd` to dampen oscillations.
Introduce `Ki` to eliminate steady-state error.

### Ziegler-Nichols Method

Set `Ki=0` and `Kd = 0`.
Increase `Kp` until the system oscillates with constant amplitude.
Note the critical gain `Ku` and period `Tu`.
Set parameters as:
 - `Kp = 0.6 * Ku`
 - `Ki = 2 * Kp / Tu`
 - `Kd = Kp * Tu / 8`

### Common Problems

<p><img src="../images/pid_plot.png" alt="PID responses under different tunings"/></p>

 - Low `Kp` (slow response): The system reacts very slowly, taking a long time to reach the setpoint.
 - High `Kp` (oscillations): The system overshoots and oscillates around the setpoint without damping.
 - Proportional + Integral (steady-state error eliminated): The system reaches the setpoint but with overshoot and slower settling time.
 - Proportional + Integral + Derivative (optimal tuning): The system reaches the setpoint quickly and without overshoot, showing balanced performance.
 - High `Ki` (overshoot and oscillations): Integral action dominates, causing overshoot and sustained oscillations.
 - High `Kd` (noise sensitivity): The derivative term overly reacts to changes, leading to instability or erratic behavior.
