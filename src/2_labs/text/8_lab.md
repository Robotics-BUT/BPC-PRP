# Lab 8 - Midterm Test (Line Following)

Responsible: Ing. Adam Ligocki, Ph.D.

Up to 50 points can be earned through two practical demonstrations during the semester.

Week 8 — Line following (25 points)

Week 12 — Corridor following (25 points)

## Line following rules

There are 3 tracks:
- Straight line (5 points)
- Simple loop (10 points)
- Complex loop (10 points)

To pass a track, the robot must follow the full length of the line.

If no part of the robot's body covers the line, the attempt fails.

Points are awarded only for completing the entire track.

Teams have 3 attempts per track, with a time limit of 3 minutes per attempt.

All 3 attempts must be performed during a single lab session.
